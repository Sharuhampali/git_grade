# GitGrade

GitGrade is an AI-powered system that evaluates GitHub repositories and converts them
into a meaningful score, honest technical summary, and personalized improvement roadmap.

## How It Works
GitGrade analyzes publicly available repository signals including:
- Folder structure and file organization
- Documentation quality (README)
- Commit history and consistency
- Testing presence
- Technology stack usage

These signals are combined with AI-assisted reasoning to generate accurate,
actionable feedback.

## Disclaimer
GitGrade provides signal-based evaluation and does not replace professional code reviews.
