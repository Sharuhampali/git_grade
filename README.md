Here is the complete, formatted `README.md` file. I have added the **Live Demo** link immediately after the introduction and completed the installation, configuration, and project details sections.

# GitGrade

**AI-Assisted GitHub Repository Evaluation & Developer Profiling**

GitGrade is a web application that evaluates public GitHub repositories and provides an **honest, signal-based assessment** of code quality, development practices, and project maturity.
It generates a **numerical score, experience level, a concise summary, and a personalized improvement roadmap**—all derived strictly from real repository data.

The goal is to help students and early developers understand *where they stand* and *what to improve next*, without inflated metrics or vague AI feedback.

## 🚀 What GitGrade Does

Given a **public GitHub repository URL**, GitGrade:

  - Fetches real repository data directly from GitHub
  - Analyzes structure, documentation, commits, testing practices, and tech stack
  - Computes a **score out of 100**
  - Assigns a **developer level** (Beginner → Expert)
  - Generates an **explainable summary** and **actionable roadmap**
  - Displays the **raw signals used** for transparency

There are **no mock values**, **no hardcoded examples**, and **no assumptions about private data**.

-----

## 🧠 Core Idea & Logic

GitGrade follows a **Repository Mirror** approach:

> Only what is visible in the repository is evaluated.

Instead of static analysis or running code (which is unreliable and unsafe at scale), GitGrade relies on **verifiable GitHub signals** that reflect real-world development habits and engineering discipline.

### Repository Signals Used

  - File and folder structure
  - Presence of a `src/` directory
  - README existence and length (documentation quality)
  - Commit count and consistency
  - Presence of tests (heuristic detection)
  - Programming languages and tech stack

These signals are:

  - Easy to verify
  - Hard to fake
  - Strong indicators of project maturity

-----

## 📊 Scoring System (0–100)

The final score is computed using a **weighted heuristic model** based on repository signals.

### Scoring Dimensions

| Category | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Structure | Project organization and scalability |
| Documentation | Clarity and completeness of README |
| Commit History | Development consistency |
| Testing | Presence of tests |
| Tech Stack | Use of multiple tools/languages |

### Level Mapping

  - **0–39** → Beginner (Bronze)
  - **40–69** → Intermediate (Silver)
  - **70–84** → Advanced (Gold)
  - **85–100** → Expert (Platinum)

The scoring is intentionally **conservative** and rewards good engineering habits rather than inflated claims.

-----

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Insights (Explainable)

GitGrade does **not** generate generic AI text.

Instead, it uses **rule-based reasoning over real repository metrics** to:

  - Summarize strengths and weaknesses
  - Identify missing best practices
  - Generate a **personalized roadmap** only where improvements are required

Every insight can be traced back to a concrete repository signal, ensuring transparency and accuracy.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

  - **Next.js (App Router)**
  - **TypeScript**
  - **shadcn/ui**
  - **Tailwind CSS**
  - **GitHub REST API**
  - **Serverless API routes**

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### 1\. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitgrade.git
cd gitgrade
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. You need a GitHub Personal Access Token (Fine-grained or Classic) to increase API rate limits. No special permissions/scopes are required for public repositories.

```bash
# .env.local
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
```

> **Why is this needed?** GitHub limits unauthenticated API requests to 60/hour. With a token, this increases to 5,000/hour.

### 4\. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

  - [ ] **Dynamic Badge Generation:** Allow users to embed their GitGrade score in their README.
  - [ ] **Multi-Repo Comparison:** Compare two repositories side-by-side.
  - [ ] **Detailed Language Analysis:** Specific advice for Python vs. JavaScript projects.
  - [ ] **History Tracking:** Track how a repository score improves over time.
